    <summary><img class="company-logo" src="PetSmart-Logo-1992.png" alt="PetSmart Logo">PetSmart â€“ Sr. Cloud Network Engineer (2022 â€“ Present)</summary>
    <p>At PetSmart, I led the design and deployment of a hybrid cloud network across AWS and Azure to support 1500+ retail locations. This included building high-availability SD-WAN connectivity using Viptela and Versa, micro-segmented Cisco ACI fabrics, and secure tunnels using Palo Alto firewalls. I implemented automated infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and Ansible, and integrated Zscaler, F5, and Panorama for centralized policy and performance management across distributed environments.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Challenges Faced</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>At PetSmart, connecting AWS, Azure, and on-prem systems caused a lot of routing problems â€” some traffic was getting lost or misrouted. I solved this by creating a standard BGP setup with Terraform that made traffic flow smoothly between all platforms. We also faced network slowdowns at over 1500 stores due to different ISPs. I fixed this by setting up smart SD-WAN policies using Viptela to prioritize important traffic like POS and voice. During Zscaler rollout, some internal apps broke due to SSL inspection. I worked with the Zscaler team to add PAC file rules that allowed the apps to work securely. Managing firewall rules across Palo Alto, ASA, and Fortinet was also messy, so I used Ansible to automate policy checks and keep things clean and consistent.</li>

    <summary><img class="company-logo" src="Amex-logo.png" alt="American Express Logo">American Express â€“ Sr. Network Engineer (2018 â€“ 2022)</summary>
    <p>At American Express, I was responsible for modernizing the global enterprise WAN. I migrated from legacy MPLS to Silver Peak SD-WAN, deployed ACI Spine-Leaf architecture, and built secure interconnects across AWS, Azure, and GCP. I led efforts on ExpressRoute, VPN gateway configurations, and Fortinet firewall segmentation. Additionally, I created automation playbooks to manage firewall policies and helped achieve PCI-DSS compliance through network segmentation and monitoring enhancements.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Challenges Faced</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>At American Express, we had to move from legacy MPLS to SD-WAN across multiple global sites. The migration was risky and caused routing overlaps at first. I used phased cutovers and Silver Peak policies to smooth the transition without downtime. Another challenge was connecting AWS, Azure, and GCP securely. I set up VPN tunnels, ExpressRoute links, and firewalls to make the multi-cloud setup stable and secure. We also needed to meet PCI-DSS compliance, so I automated firewall changes using Ansible and Python to reduce manual errors. Cisco ACI also had setup problems â€” I fixed these by checking health scores and automating rollbacks.

    <summary><img class="company-logo" src="Polygon_logo.png" alt="Polygon Logo">Polygon â€“ Network Engineer (2017 â€“ 2018)</summary>
    <p>At Polygon, I helped implement a scalable LAN/WAN network to support logistics operations across branch offices. I deployed Cisco and Juniper routers and switches, built VLAN trunking and access control using ACLs, and configured BGP/OSPF for stable routing. I also set up DMVPN, conducted Wireshark-based packet analysis, and supported WAN link monitoring to ensure reliable communication between remote offices and data centers.</p>
    <p class="tools-used"><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Cisco, Juniper, VLAN, ACL, BGP, OSPF, DMVPN, Wireshark</p>
    <details>
      <summary>Challenges Faced</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>At Polygon, we were building branch networks with Cisco and Juniper gear. One issue was routing loops caused by incorrect OSPF settings, which I fixed by adjusting route costs after using Wireshark to trace the problem. The ACLs were hard to manage and confusing, so I replaced static rules with object-group ACLs to simplify everything. We also had failover delays with DMVPN, especially during link failures. I tuned the failover settings and improved response times. To catch problems earlier, I set up SNMP alerts and centralized logging so our team could react faster to network issues.
